    any provision of this Agreement is deemed invalid by a court of competent
    jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect the

    any subsequent breach.
</p>

    waiver of that right or power. Nor shall any single or partial exercise of
    any right or power under this Agreement preclude further exercise of that
    or any other right granted herein. In the event of a conflict between this
    Agreement and any applicable purchase or other terms, the terms of this
    Agreement shall govern.
