# Contributing to Thunderdome

We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

Becoming a maintainer

## Code of Conduct

Please read the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) document.

## We Develop with GitHub

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

### We Use [Github Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we
use [GitHub Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed/added APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the Apache 2.0 Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the
same [Apache 2.0 License](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the
maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/StevenWeathers/thunderdome-planning-poker/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](); it's that easy!

### Versioning

We use [SemVer](http://semver.org/) for versioning. For the versions available, see
the [tags on this repository](https://github.com/StevenWeathers/thunderdome-planning-poker/tags).

## Coding Conventions

- Follow [Effective Go](https://go.dev/doc/effective_go)
  and [Code Review Comments Guide](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments) from the Go project as much as
  possible within reason.
- All library code is linted with `npm run prettier` and `goimports` on every commit.
- Unit tests are run on every commit.
